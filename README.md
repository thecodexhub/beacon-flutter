# Beacon-Flutter

A Flutter Application that is able to share your location with anyone who has a specific passkey.

## Overview

Suppose you are going to start a hike with friends and you want them to know your location but only for a certain duration (let say for 3 hours). You can do that just by creating a random passkey and your friends can track your location with that passkey.

Some screenshots are -

<div style="text-align: center"><table><tr>
<td style="text-align: center">
<img src="screenshots/ss_one.png" width="200" />
</td>
<td style="text-align: center">
<img src="screenshots/ss_two.png" width="200"/>
</td>
</tr></table>
</div>
